# datamining
This project show how we can classify bad and googd comments from comments extracted in a csv file. 
The data is in Tunisian  Dialects, which makes it really hard to clean,
as their are different ways of writing a word. 
we used a basic machine learning model to divide comments, bad ones are labeled as -1 whereas good ones were labeled as +1.
At the very last, the model gave an accuracy of 75%.
